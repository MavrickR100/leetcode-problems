# 📘 LeetCode Solutions – Auto Synced 🚀

An automated repository of my LeetCode solutions, synchronized using a Chrome extension.  
Every accepted submission is automatically committed to GitHub, maintaining a structured and version-controlled archive of my DSA practice.

---

## 🔥 Purpose

Consistency is key in mastering Data Structures & Algorithms.

This repository:

- Automatically tracks solved LeetCode problems
- Maintains a clean and consistent commit history
- Demonstrates disciplined problem-solving practice
- Acts as a public record of my DSA journey

Automation ensures:
- Zero manual uploads
- Real-time GitHub updates
- Accurate tracking of progress

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- A Chrome extension connects LeetCode to GitHub.
- When a solution is **Accepted**, it is automatically:
    - Committed
    - Pushed to this repository
    - Organized by problem name

No manual steps required after submission.
